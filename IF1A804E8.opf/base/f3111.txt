by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Emaho!Most sublime of places, celestial realm of ḍākinīs,In the country of Sikkim, king of hidden
lands,On a mountainside at the north-west border[2]Is Gawa Lung, the Valley of Joy,
or Valley of Vajra Medicine,With clay, slate and rocky cliffs, meadows and woods.

It is a place where Indian adepts and scholarsLike the Lord of Oḍḍiyāna, Virūpa, Saraha and
Ḍombī,As well as Tibet’s own accomplished awareness-holders,Such as Tsogyal, venerable Drok,
Nanam Dorje Dudjom,Lüi Wangpo, Milarepa, Thangtong Gyalpo and others have practised.

There are eight caves and the splendid hill of the delighted playOf the wisdom-mind protector
who bears a hooked knife.

Amitāyus, Kurukullā, Tārā,And other buddhas and bodhisattvasHave left blessed impressions of
their hands and feetAnd there is a wondrous array of countlessRepresentations of enlightened
body, speech and mind.

There is a golden lake, a milky lake and a great lake of rakta,Life-enhancing waters of the
divine nectar of immortality,And excellent trees which support the five sister ḍākinīs.Its
grassy plains are as smooth and even as a mirror.At a slight elevation a temple with the
three supports has been established.

Here the torments of malevolent hostile forces are pacified.This is a place of accomplishment
for yogis and vidyādharas,A place to escape dangers to life and bring activity to fruition,A
place from which the teachings of Secret Mantra may spread throughout the ten directions.And
it is possible that there are also extremely secret, profound treasures to be found
herein.

This extremely concise guide to the celestial Valley of JoyIs an instruction imparted to Tri
Song.Samaya!

The following was concealed separately and anew.Near that place which has thus been describedIs
the hidden land of Rinchen Ding.[3]Within a circle of rocky cliffsIs a vast plain with
a garden in which there areFine medicinal fruits and flowers of various kinds.A pond in its
cornerIs a place that delights White and Green Tārā—Extremely pleasant with beautiful beasts,Echoing
with the sweetest of birdsong.Here is the cavern of vajra immortality,Like a
second Māratika.Here too is a secret ḍākinī caveAnd a cave that delights the great Awesome
OneOf the nine classes of yidam accomplishment.

Merely travelling to a place of such delightful cavesAnd rocky shelters is enough to makeWind-energy
and awareness clear and inspire bliss and joy.Performing authentic practice, offering
gaṇacakra and so onWill immediately pacify all obstructing forcesAnd bring rebirth on
the Glorious Mountain in Cāmara.

If those who sincerely wish to practice sacred DharmaIn such a sublime place as this make the
journey,They will be protected from the terrors of foreign invasion,Lead long, healthy lives
of happiness and fulfilmentAnd experience abundant fortune and auspiciousness.

Samaya. Guhya.
